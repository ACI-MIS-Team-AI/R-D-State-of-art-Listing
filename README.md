This is a continuously updated repository that documents journey on state-of-art learning data science, machine learning related topics.

**Goal:** Introduce machine learning contents in Jupyter Notebook format. The content aims to strike a good balance between mathematical notations, educational implementation from scratch using Python's scientific stack including numpy, numba, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, etc. and open-source library usage such as scikit-learn, pyspark, gensim, keras, pytorch, tensorflow, etc.
